Idea: Basket Minder Landing Page (Website for new app)

Details: A new app has been released to help facilitate purchase and reminders for the Bountiful Baskets Food Co-op. This site will serve as the web landing-page for the app. The website has 4 functions:
Serve as the google-able home of BasketMinder. 
Allow users to submit bug/feature requests via a restful service
Link other resources (appstore and facebook page)
Present to users a FAQ page and tutorial for the app
In addition to the site functions, a RESTful web service will facilitate subscription to notifications used in the app and retrieval of bug/feature submissions.
